Displays 2 chairs and a bench. You can view in 3 modes: orthogonal, persective, or first person. Use of the arrow keys and other keys for each respective view changes the viewing angles.

Key bindings
  m         Toggles viewing mode between orthogonal and perspective
  f         Toggles first-person mode on/off
  0         Resets view angle to 45,45 (orthogonal and perspective only)
  Arrows    Changes the view angle (orthogonal and perspective only)
  +         Zooms in (perspective mode only)
  -         Zooms out (perspective mode only)
  i         Moves camera angle 'forward' (first-person only)
  k         Moves camera angle 'backward' (first-person only)
  j         Rotates camera angle left (first-person only)
  l         Rotates camera angle right (first-person only)
  ESC       Closes the window
