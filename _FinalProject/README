Final Project - The Living Room: It's for living

To run: you can do a normal make ("make room").

Welcome to the living room! It's a great place to...live.
In the living room, you can find beautiful hardwood floors. There is a comfy TV viewing area in the front, complete with a long microfiber couch, a comfy armchair, an exotic ottoman, a classic wood side table, a TV stand, and a huge flat screen LCD screen. Check out what's on cable by pressing 't' on your remote (or keyboard). In the back you'll find a huge oak bookcase with a super awesome ping pong table (complete with ping pong ball). Revolving around the scene is our own little personal Sun that shows off the great lighting of the whole scene.
Turning on the walls (with 'w') shows you the beautiful textured blue walls in the room. Zooming out will show you the brick exterior against the crazy cloudy sky scene.
Pressing 'f' puts you in the scene! Use the ('y','g','h','j') keys to move around the scene from what I like to call "first dog" point of view (since you're a little lower). Pressing 'p' will change the view from orthogonal to perspective for a cool way of looking at the room (best used from angles further away - hit '0' and then 'p').

I put a lot of work into getting crisp looking objects and placing them. I believe this is worth an A because it really shows a lot of different aspects of computer graphics, including the well-executed lighting, beautiful texturing, multiple view modes, complex objects, and fun aspects like being able to turn on the TV.
