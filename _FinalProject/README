Notes: I realize I haven't done much. I don't have the walls up right now just so I can focus on the objects and right now the tv isn't working quite right. I still plan on putting in a lot more detailed objects like an armchair (in progess), tables with lamps, tv (in progress), pictures, and other miscellaneous items. I also need to integrate first person collisions.
